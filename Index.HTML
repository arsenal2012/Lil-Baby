        <p>Dominique Armani Jones[3] (born December 3, 1994), known professionally as Lil Baby, is an American rapper
            from Atlanta, Georgia. He rose to mainstream fame in 2017 following the release of his mixtape Perfect
            Timing.[4] His debut studio album, Harder Than Ever (2018), spawned the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 single "Yes
            Indeed" (with Drake). In 2018, he released two more mixtapes: Drip Harder (with Gunna), which contained the
            single, "Drip Too Hard", that reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was later certified Diamond by the
            Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); and Street Gossip, which reached #2 on the US Billboard
            200.

            His second studio album, My Turn (2020), reached #1 on the Billboard 200 and is certified triple-platinum by
            the RIAA. The album spawned the singles, "We Paid" (with 42 Dugg) and "The Bigger Picture", both of which
            reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.[5] In 2021, Lil Baby and rapper Lil Durk released the
            collaborative album The Voice of the Heroes, which became Lil Baby's second chart-topping project. He
            collaborated with Drake on the songs "Wants and Needs", and "Girls Want Girls", and with Nicki Minaj on the
            song "Do We Have a Problem?", all three of which debuted and peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
            His feature on the song "Hurricane" by Kanye West, alongside The Weeknd, won him the Grammy Award for Best
            Melodic Rap Performance.
